How it works now:

- show grid of scratches based on table with objects.
- display hardcoded img, title, date, likes and finished for each one.

Features that will be added:

- like function
- total finished count by user
- finish date
- visual scratching animation

What i used and learned:

- React (useState, props Drilling, ternary operators)
- JS (map, filter)
- react-icons.github.io
