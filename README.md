How it works now:

- show grid of scratches based on db.json with objects,
- display hardcoded in db.json img, title, date, likes and finished for each one,
- you can like only finished activities,
- you will see the date of finish after finishing.

Features that will be added:

- visual scratching animation
- login feature
-
- selecting random 10 scratches per user

What i used and learned:

- React (useState, useEffect, props Drilling, ternary operators),
- JS (map, filter),
- react-icons.github.io,
- CSS modules,
- convencial commits from 4 commit,
- connection with json-server and CRUD operations.
