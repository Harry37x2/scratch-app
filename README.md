How it works now:

- show grid of scratches based on db.json with objects,
- display hardcoded in db.json img, title, date, likes and finished for each one,
- you can like only finished activities,
- you will see the date of finish, photo and have possibility to like after finishing.

Features that will be added:

- visual scratching animation
- login feature with firebase
- crud with firebase
- selecting random 10 scratches per user
- user scratches on lazy loading
- adding you photo for each scratch after finishing
- useContext

What i used and learned:

- React (useState, useEffect, props Drilling, ternary operators),
- React Router (SharedLayout, useParams, Links)
- JS (map, filter),
- react-icons.github.io,
- CSS modules,
- convencial commits from 4 commit,
- connection with json-server and CRUD operations.
